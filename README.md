Breakout
======================
You win if the wall is destroyed; lose if the ball touches the bottom of the screen. 

Controls
-----------
Left, right - to move paddle. Space - to start the game or pause.

Notes
-------------
The game isn’t perfect, there are some bugs and game physics isn’t nice at all, but it’s not important for me. 
My primary target was to finish this game, not to perfect it.
